# madison_zoning_explorer
A Shiny app to explore where in Madison you can build/open specific types of businesses or housing

# Development status
Abandoned. The zoning code is so complex that I have just given up.

## Basic concept
The app will use city of Madison zoning data from their open data portal as well as directly from ordinance to draw a map of where certain land uses are and are not permitted. 

## Features 
- [ ] toggle to distinguish use by right and conditional use. 
- [ ] link to zoning code definitions (or provide them in the app if linking is not possible)
- [ ] select combination of land uses (e.g. "any multi-family housing" vs "only multi-family housing over x units") where that makes sense
- [ ] information about parking requirements
